# SoC-Loan-approval-Predict
Following repo contains all the files relevant to my institute's Summer of Code event in which I am participating and working on the project "Loan Approval Prediction".
### Week 1
In week one, we learnt the basics of python like lists, dictionaries,loops, arrays etc. And also how to use google colab and Jupyter. This helped in getting me familiar with python.
### Week 2
In week 2 we learnt about numpy, pandas and matplotlib and how to import files into colab and about the mathematics of Machine learning. This helped me in understading how to understand large amounts of data and draw conclusions from it
